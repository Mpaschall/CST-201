Project: Maze Project

Milestone 2

With this milestone i attempted to utilize a LinkedList to store all of the MazeSqaure objects in. Under false pretenses i assumed that by using the x and y coordinates i could determine where the individual objects were stored in the list. For example the square located at 8 x 6 would be stored 86th on the list, which is not the case if there are 10 x 11 positions in the maze.

Utilizing a list for this makes the project much more difficult because just positioning the squares correctly becomes a daunting task. Before when utilizing an array, it was easy to determine where each of the squares fell and therefor easy to position them and display them as needed.

When utilizing a list the squares themselves need to be changed to store their location, which is an entirely different problem in itself.

Maze 1 is far more efficient than maze 2, solely because of the data structure that maze 1 uses.
